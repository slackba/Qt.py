With some help from Stephan Deibel
of Wingware, I got auto completion of
Qt.py working in WING IDE using this
interface file (pointed to in Source
Analysis) and a collection of PYI files
generated using a WING utility.

Questions to iam@nimajneb.com if you're
using wing and need to get this working.
